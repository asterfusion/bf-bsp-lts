/******************************************************************************

This file contains information about accessing Tofino SPI EEPROM thru I2c 
method for using it on Barefoot switches and porting it on other platforms.

SPI EEPROM that is connected to Tofino switch contains firmware necessary to
bring up the Tofino's PCIe link. SPI access controller resides on Tofino chip. 
It must be accessed by i2c means when the ASIC is not accesible on PCIe bus for
whatever reasons.

The files provided here make up a C program to read and write EEPROM thru i2c
means. The porting layer is clearly defined that must be implemented for the 
given platform.


Description of files:

tofino_spi_if.c: All necessary functions to read and program the EEPROM 
including a main(). The usage is as per print_usage() output. The command takes
a file name that contains binary data to write in the EEPROM and read from the
EEPROM. <offset> is the offset into the SPI eeprom to read or write and it 
defaults to zero if not supplied in the command line. <size> is the number of 
bytes to write into eeprom or read from eeprom (from <offset>). If it is not
supplied in the command line, it defaults to the file size if writing and EEPROM
size if reading from the EEPROM. The program checks for maximum size of EEPROM 
against "BF_SPI_EEPROM_SIZE". 

tofino_spi_if.h: contains necessary macros plus forward declarations of the 
                 functions of the poring layer.

/* Any platform specific initialization necessary for setting up i2c access 
 * to the ASIC. This function is called before the the access of the ASIC begins
 */
int tofino_porting_spi_init(int dev_id, void *arg);

/* Any platform specific cleanup necessary for shutting down i2c access to the 
 * ASIC. This function is called after the access of the ASIC completes. 
 */
int tofino_porting_spi_finish(int dev_id);

/* Platform specific functions to write <data> to a register at offset <reg> 
 * within the ASIC <devi_id>
 */
int tofino_porting_spi_reg_wr(int dev_id, uint32_t reg, uint32_t data);

/* Platform specific functions to read <data> from a register at offset <reg> 
 * within the ASIC <devi_id>
*/
int tofino_porting_spi_reg_rd(int dev_id, uint32_t reg, uint32_t *data);

tofino_porting_spi.c:
This file implements the porting functions implemented for a given platform.

tofino_porting_spi.h:
Header file for porting implementation.


How to make :
The Makefile in this folder is tailored to the Mavericks build requirements. 
A platform specific Makefile must be created. If there is no dependencies, 
following command line, at the minimum would work.

gcc -o spi_i2c_util tofino_porting_spi.c tofino_spi_if.c
